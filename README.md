This Repo containt a documentation of my personal setup, to gain access via eBUS with ebusd to my Ochsner Heatpump Air 11 C11A with Unifresh 500 as buffer/boiler. 
For some general information please refer to the Wiki.
# [Ochsner Air 11 C 11 A](https://www.ochsner.com/de-de/ochsner-produkte/air-11-c11a/)
The (on/off) air source heat pump (equipped with an embedded auxiliary heater) has been installed in September 2021 with an Unifresh 500 buffer/boiler (fresh-water station). To control the heat pump, Ochsner is using controllers from [TEM Group](https://www.tem.ch/), thus there is a lot of documentation available as many other vendors also implement TEM controllers in their heat pumps. Many different heat pump models from Ochsner have the same eBUS components embedded and share the same eBUS addresses for many different values and parameters.
