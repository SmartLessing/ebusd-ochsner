This Folder contains documentation only relevant for creating the ebusd configuration files and templates (not for any hardware or software setup), nor any instructions on how to use ebusd.
The Excel-File is my master table where all ebus IDs (TEM_P) have descriptions (derived from Ochsner or other relevant documentation) aded in german and english language. In addition all different operations modes and status-codes are listed with their specific numeric values and text-strings. The ebus Addresses have been identified and confirmed (working with MY heatpump model) values are marked with green background color.
I also added the Datatypes relevant for decoding the payload (might not be 100% correct yet) as well as other useful information (like "string" - Text for mapping of values to strings used in the _template.csv).
WORK IN PROGREASS - not all addresses have been verified or added to the configuration files yet.
